              Then you try again, and it’s not discouraging. It can challenge

            <p>
              Math Snacks, a game-based learning platform directed at middle
              school, did a thorough study on the game's impact. Before
              implementing Math Snacks, students showed significant gaps in
              understanding of ratios and number systems concepts. The study
              showed that students who were taught ratio and number line
              concepts with the aid of Math Snacks showed greater improvement
              than students taught more traditionally. This is seen in the graph
              to the left. Students were divided into two groups. All students
              took test 1 and had similar results. Group A was then taught the
              subject material and implemented games from Math Snacks. Group B
              was taught the content in a traditional method. Group A had
              greater success based on the results from test 2 that occurred
              five weeks later. Group B was then also taught with Math Snacks,
              and students’ success level caught up to group A, as shown with
              test 3.

            <br />
            <p>
              Algebra Champ is a one-player video game that helps students with
              algebra. The game was used in a study with students who have ADHD.
              Students played the game for 10 minutes in each math class for
              three weeks. Teachers noticed an increase in the attention span
              and motivation of students, as well as an increase in test scores.
              No conclusive results were drawn due to the small number of
              participants in the study. Teachers indicated that using the game
              in their class created a more relaxed environment.

          Keys to Implementing Game-Based Learning
        </h2>

        <p class="lead">
          Keep these practises in mind when implementing game-based learning
          into your own classroom.

            <h3>Learning Goals</h3>
            <p>
              Ensure the game aligns with your learning goals. Will playing this
              game help students meet the desired target?
            </p>
          </div>

            </i>
            <h3>Practise the game yourself</h3>
            <p>
              Ask yourself, do the instructions for the game make sense? Is the
              game intrinsically motivating to play? Will it capture my
              students' interests?
            </p>

            </i>
            <h3>Learner Needs</h3>
            <p>
              Consider the needs of your students. Does the game allow for
              different learning styles? Will any aspects of the game be
              inaccessible to some of your students?
            </p>
          </div>

              <div class="process-step">4</div>
            </i>
            <h3>Clear Expectations</h3>
            <p>
              Any activity can be abused by students. As a class, come up with a
              list of norms that the class will follow when playing the games.
            </p>

            </i>
            <h3>Time</h3>
            <p>
              Playing a game once for a few minutes at the start of class will
              not transform your learning environment. Class time must be
              invested to play the game.
            </p>

            <h3>Variety of Instruction</h3>
            <p>
              Game-based learning should not be the sole form of instruction in
              the classroom. A variety of instructional methods should always be
              used.

            </i>
            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>
              Ensure students receive formative feedback throughout the game.
              This should come from both the game itself and you as an educator.
            </p>

            </i>
            <h3>Reflection</h3>
            <p>
              Reflection is a crucial piece of learning that is often
              overlooked. Both large and small group discussions, exit slips,
              and other forms of instruction should be used to help students
              consolidate their learning.
