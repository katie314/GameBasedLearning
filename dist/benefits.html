            <h3>Theoretical Roots</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              Kids have been playing games since the beginning of time. With the
              advent of technology, many of these games are now played on a
              digital platform. Over the years, there has been growing criticism
              regarding children playing video games. There are claims that
              video games are an addictive form of entertainment that hinder
              students' brain development. However, the dispositions students
              exhibit while playing video games, such as engagement, intrinsic
              motivation to play, and persistence in the face of difficulty, are
              the same attitudes teachers want to develop in their students
              towards learning. As a result, educators are beginning to realize
              we can harness students’ love of video games rather than criticize
              it. Games are now being used in the classroom as another form of
              learning.
              <br /><br />
              The term “game-based learning” refers to supporting teaching and
              learning with video games designed for use in an educational
              setting. Not only does game-based learning assist students in
              learning content knowledge, but these games help develop attitudes
              and skills that can be applied to real-life situations.

            <h3>Flow State Theory</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              When playing these games, students enter into a flow state. The
              flow state is a state of deep engrossment with the task at hand,
              where one is intrinsically motivated to complete the task. In a
              flow state, concentration, enjoyment, and interest with the
              activity co-occur. Establishing a flow state requires a balance
              between challenge and the skills needed to accomplish those
              challenges. A task must not be too easy (leads to boredom) or too
              difficult (leads to anxiety). Appropriate and new challenges
              result in increased skills that allow for more difficult
              challenges. Flow states optimize learning.

              The Application of Game-Based Learning in Education: <br />
              Gee's Principles of Learning
            </h2>

            <h3>Empowered Learners</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Co-design Principle: Learners must feel like what they do
                matters. When students play a game, they are co-designing the
                game because they have to make choices that impact the game.
              </li>
              <li>
                Customization Principle: Students need to be able to customize
                their learning. Good games allow students to solve problems in
                different and new ways.
              </li>
              <li>
                Identity Principle: When learning, students need to be given the
                opportunity to take on roles, for example, take on the role of a
                scientist. Games give students an identity, "an avatar," with
                goals allowing students to take on various roles.
              </li>
              <li>
                Manipulation Principle: Neuroscience shows that when we know we
                can manipulate something, we, in a sense, become that person.
                This is seen in video games when kids will sometimes jump when
                their character jumps. As a result, students deeply involve
                their mind and body in both the learning and the game.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Problem Solving</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Well-Ordered Problems: When learning, early problems need to
                build up a skillset to complete more complicated problems later.
                Games naturally do this through the use of levels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pleasantly Frustrating: Learning happens best when you know you
                can do something, but it is challenging enough to feel like an
                accomplishment once you complete it. This goes back to the flow
                state theory discussed above.
              </li>
              <li>
                The Cycle of Expertise: This cycle occurs when you give someone
                a challenging problem and they practise it until they can do it
                in their sleep. Then, you give them a new challenge that
                requires new knowledge to be integrated with their old
                knowledge. This cycle of challenging expertise continues. Games
                implement this principle through the use of levels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Information Principle: Information is effective when given just
                in time (information provided on the spot that you can apply) or
                on demand (when you know you need new information and seek it
                out).
              </li>
              <li>
                Fish Tank Principle: Learning happens when complexity increases
                gradually. Again, games do this through the use of levels.
              </li>
              <li>
                Sandbox Principle: Learners need to time explore and take risks,
                as kids do in sandboxes. Games allow students to explore in
                low-risk situations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Skills as Strategies Principle: You need to practise skills over
                and over. Games put these skills under a goal that students
                desire to reach.
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Deep Understanding</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>
                System Thinking: Games are a system of rules that work together.
                This element teaches students how variables work together and
                can be used to reach their goals.
              </li>
              <li>
                Situated Meaning: Words have meaning if you can associate
                images, actions, and goals with them. Games add these
                experiences and goals that students need to understand words.
