          Game-based learning is an approach to instruction that has been
          gaining traction over the past few years. The term “game-based
          learning” refers to using video games to support teaching and
          learning. There has been an increase in the quantity of game-based
          learning options available, though not games are created equal. Today,
          teachers are faced with the challenge of deciding which games enhance
          rather than distract from student learning. Other factors, such as the
          cost and time to implement, must also be considered.
